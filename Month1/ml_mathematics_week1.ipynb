    "\n",
    "    The \"**span**\" of two vectors is the set of all their linear combinations.**Linear dependency** if they don't add information or in other words, one vector v-> can be expressed as a linear combination of the other w->. Linear independence is therefore when w-> != av->. Basis vectors are therefore linearly independent vectors that span the full space of their **vector space**.\n",

    "\n",
    "    A **transformation** can be described in a 2x2 matrix(or as a function f(x,y) on the basis vectors of the space, that when applied on a vector will give you the transformed vector. The grid lines remain parallel and evenly spaced and the origin remains fixed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If you have linearly dependent columns of your 2x2 matrix, as shown in Video 2, one transformations is a linearly streched out version of the other, which means that they will squish to a a 1D line(1D span) instead of 2D space.\n",

    "\n",
    "    Then applying to tranformations i.E. first rotation 90Â° then Shear is the same as multiplying the vector by the composition, which is the matrix multiplication of the 2 tranformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Matrix multiplication** process and the thinking is that first we apply one tranformation and then use that result for the second transformation. Also notice that the order matters(m1*m2!=m2*m1)"
